# Decission Tree I Phone Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyse a dataset containing information about individuals' gender, age, salary, and likelihood
to purchase an iPhone (binary classification: 1 for purchase, 0 for no purchase).
The project involves various steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection and imputation, and
building a predictive model using Decision Tree classification.

## Methodology
The initial step involved importing necessary Python packages and loading the dataset.
The dataset consists of the following columns: Gender, Age, Salary, and Purchase iPhone.

## Model Planning and Training
The decision was made to use the Decision Tree classification model for predicting iPhone purchases. 'Purchase iPhone' was considered the dependent variable, and the
other columns were treated as independent variables.

# Conclusion
The project successfully explored and analysed a dataset related to gender, age, salary, and iPhone purchase behaviour.
By employing label encoding, outlier detection, and the Decision Tree classification model, the analysis yielded valuable insights into predicting iPhone purchases. 
The final model demonstrated a high accuracy rate, indicating its reliability in predicting purchase behaviour based on given parameters.
